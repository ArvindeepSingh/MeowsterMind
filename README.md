## Available Scripts

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Refer to the [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder, bundling React in production mode for optimal performance. The filenames include hashes, and your app will be ready for deployment.

Refer to the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for further information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you're dissatisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, use `eject` to copy all configuration files and dependencies into your project. This gives you full control over them, although it's a one-time operation.
